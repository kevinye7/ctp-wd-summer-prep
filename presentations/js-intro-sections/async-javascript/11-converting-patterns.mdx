## Converting Patterns: Callbacks → Promises → Async/Await

**Step 1: Callback to Promise**
```javascript
// Callback version
function saveData(data, callback) {
  setTimeout(() => callback(null, { success: true }), 1000);
}

// Promise version  
function saveData(data) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve({ success: true }), 1000);
  });
}
```

**Step 2: Promise Chain to Async/Await**
```javascript
// Promise chain
return saveData(data)
  .then(result => updateUI(result))
  .then(ui => logActivity(ui));

// Async/await
const result = await saveData(data);
const ui = await updateUI(result);
return await logActivity(ui);
```

**For the exercise**: Convert a complex promise chain into clean async/await code.
<Notes>
Converting between async patterns is a common real-world task. Many legacy codebases use callbacks, while modern APIs use Promises. Understanding these conversions helps you work with any codebase and modernize old code.

The callback-to-Promise conversion wraps the callback pattern in a Promise constructor. The key insight is that resolve and reject replace the callback. Where callbacks use error-first convention (callback(error, result)), Promises separate these concerns - reject for errors, resolve for success.

Converting Promise chains to async/await is usually straightforward but requires attention to detail. Each .then() becomes an await, but you need to ensure proper variable scoping. In Promise chains, each .then() creates a new scope, while async/await uses the same scope throughout the function.

One gotcha: in Promise chains, returning a value automatically wraps it in a Promise. With async/await, you might need to explicitly return values. Also, Promise.all() for parallel operations doesn't have a direct async/await equivalent - you still use Promise.all() but await its result. These conversions are essential skills for maintaining and upgrading JavaScript applications.
