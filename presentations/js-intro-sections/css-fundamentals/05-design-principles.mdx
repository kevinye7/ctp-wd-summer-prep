## Overview: CSS Design Principles

Before styling the habit card, plan your design approach:

- Layout Strategy:
    - Choose between Flexbox (1D layout) vs Grid (2D layout)
    - Consider content hierarchy and information flow
    - Plan for responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Visual Hierarchy:
    - Use typography scale (headings, body text, captions)
    - Color coding for categories and status indicators
    - Visual weight through size, color, and spacing

Good CSS isn't just about knowing properties - it's about applying design principles to create effective user interfaces. Before writing any CSS, step back and plan your approach. This planning phase separates professional work from amateur attempts.

Layout strategy is your foundation. Flexbox excels at component layouts where elements flow in one direction - navigation bars, card rows, or form layouts. Grid shines for page layouts where you need precise control over both dimensions. Often, you'll combine both - Grid for the overall structure, Flexbox for components within grid areas.

Visual hierarchy guides users through your interface. The most important elements should be most prominent through size, color, contrast, or position. Typography creates hierarchy naturally - larger, bolder text draws attention. Color should reinforce this hierarchy, not fight against it. Use your brightest, most saturated colors sparingly for calls-to-action.

Spacing is often overlooked but crucial. Consistent spacing creates rhythm and helps users parse information. Use a spacing scale (like 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px) rather than arbitrary values. Whitespace isn't wasted space - it's a design element that improves readability and creates focus. These principles apply whether you're styling a simple card or a complex dashboard.
